# Chibi Engine (WIP)

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/chibiengine.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/chibiengine)
[![Maintainability Rating](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=ChibiEngine_ChibiEngine&metric=sqale_rating)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=ChibiEngine_ChibiEngine)

Chibi Engine aims to offer a modern and simple approach to game development with web technologies. It takes advantage of TypeScript and ES6 features such as asynchronism, classes, and mixins for a flexible and maintainable programming methodology, inspired by popular game engines.

Its main objective is to pave the way for cross-engine game development. In this way it introduces an abstraction layer over existing engines to simplify the development process, gathering their common features under a unified API, while still allowing developers to leverage specific engine capabilities.

Additionally, Chibi Engine aims to integrate usual game creation features such as an entity component system, a physics engine and camera system.

Currently, the main target is [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs).

## Objectives
- Modern API, easy to use. Inspired by [Flash](https://help.adobe.com/fr_FR/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/package-detail.html) and [Cocos2d-x](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/api-ref/cplusplus/v4x/). 
- Focused on Object-Oriented Programming through an extensible node and component system.
- Implicit dynamic assets loading.
